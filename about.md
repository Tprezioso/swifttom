## Learning How to program in Swift

The posts on this blog are about the different things I have learned while learning how to programming using the Swift programming language.

My goal is to share post on Swift topic that I have learned about or things I have recently be working on and found was really cool!

This page is mostly a digital journal to help me solve coding issue or problems I have had in past with a repo I can quickly look up the solution too!
